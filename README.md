# House_Price_Prediction
🏡 House Price Prediction Model
📌 Overview
This project predicts house prices based on various property and location features using Machine Learning.
The model is built with Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn and trained on a real-world housing dataset.

📊 Features Used for Prediction
Median Income – Average income in the area

House Age – Age of the property in years

Average Rooms – Average number of rooms per household

Average Bedrooms – Average number of bedrooms per household

Population – Population in the area

Average Occupancy – Average household size

Latitude & Longitude – Geographic location of the property

⚙️ Technologies & Libraries
Python 3.x

Pandas – Data handling

NumPy – Numerical operations

Matplotlib – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Model training & evaluation

🚀 How It Works
Data Preprocessing – Loads and cleans the dataset

Feature Selection – Uses relevant housing and location features

Model Training – Applies regression algorithms to learn price patterns

Evaluation – Uses R² score and Mean Absolute Error for accuracy check

Prediction – Takes user input for property details and predicts price
